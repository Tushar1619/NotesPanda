                    NotePanda is a digital note-taking app that provides a single place for keeping all of your notes, research, plans, and information — everything you need to remember and manage in your life at home, at work, or at school.

                    In NotePanda, notebooks never run out of paper. Notes are easy to organize, print, and share, and you can search and find important information quickly, even if you forget where you've originally captured it. Best of all, your notebooks are stored online so you can easily get to them on any of your mobile devices.

                Take command over your next project, trip, or class. NotesPanda notebooks are designed to make organization optional but easy. Every notebook is automatically organized into sections which contain pages — letting you decide visually how you want to arrange your notes. Keep one section for your song writing, another one for recipes, or start jotting down plans for your next vacation or the new school year. Freely move things around whenever and however you want. Whatever you care about, NotesPanda makes it easy to keep tabs on everything in your life.

                NotesPanda can do things your old paper notebooks can only dream about. Use tags to categorize and prioritize notes that need to stand out. Whether you’re making a simple checklist or planning a large-scale event like a wedding, you can easily mark what’s important, call out what’s still in question, and assign action items for yourself and others. Add To-Do tags to your lists with a simple click, so you can check off and track your progress, even when you switch between your devices on the go. And forget about flipping through pages trying to find something — NotesPanda puts all of your information at your fingertips with a quick search, no matter where you might have jotted it down.
